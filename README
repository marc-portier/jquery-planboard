jquery based Planboard viewer with events and callbacks for managing planning schedules of many kinds.


How can I see this working:
--------------------------
- checkout from github
- open src/test/webenv/basic.html in a browser

(when using chrome be sure to add the switch: --allow-file-access-from-files the current in-browser use of less.js requires that)


Current state:
-------------
WORKING:
  - visualization of grid, dates, allocations and special periods
    - including scrolling and resizing effects
  - possibility to add dates in front and at the back


NOT WORKING:
  - none of the promissed events and callbacks, but feel free to propose some extension points as we go allong


DOCS:
  - we are fully in the 'docs are for wimps' -state :) 
    no honestly: there is no api yet, the code is small and should be documenting itself at the moment... the only exception is the documentation you are reading now :)


YOU:
  - open for comments and contributions


NEXT/TODO:
  - see javascript file...
